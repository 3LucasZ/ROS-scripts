# ROS-scripts

A repository of some introductory yet useful ROS-scripts.

A couple of these are regular programs, and not associated with ROS. They are just for testing particular components. 

They are primarily written in Python2, although a couple in Python3.

This has been written and tested for:

  Raspberry pi4 with Ubuntu

  ROS Kinetic

There are certain components required:

  An ultrasonic sensor, attached to a servo.
  
  The ws2812 LED ring from NeoPixel.
  
  (Also install the library for using this module.)
    
  A speaker connected to the audio jack and properly configured.
  
  An RGB Led.
  
  Still in the process of properly commenting and documenting these. If any questions arise, please post under issues.
