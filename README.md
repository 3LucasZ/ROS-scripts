# ROS-scripts
A repository of some introductory yet useful ROS-scripts.
A couple of these are regular programs, and not associated with ROS. They are just for testing particular components. 
They are primarily written in Python2, although a couple in Python3.

This has been written and tested for:
  Raspberry pi4 with Ubuntu
  ROS Kinetic

There are certain components required:
  An ultrasonic sensor, attached to a servo.
  The ws2812 LED ring from NeoPixel.
    Also install the Adafruit_Blink library.
  A speaker connected to the audio jack and properly configured.
  An RGB Led.
